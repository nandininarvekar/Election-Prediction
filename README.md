# Election Prediction using Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Feeds


Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, play a crucial role in political campaigns by generating vast amounts of data in the form of microblogging. This data, reflecting public sentiment and reactions to political events, has been successfully used in several countries such as  the US, UK, Spain, and France to predict election outcomes. This project proposes a machine learning approach to analyze Twitter data for forecasting the results of the 2020 Irish General Election using the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm and the NLTK library.
